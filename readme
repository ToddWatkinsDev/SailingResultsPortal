# Sailing Results Portal

This is a **web-based sailing results management portal** built with **ASP.NET Core MVC** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. 

## Purpose

The portal supports managing sailing race events, including multiple races and classes, with a focus on dinghies and yachts scored using Portsmouth Yardstick, IRC, and YTC handicap systems.

## Key Features

- Manage multiple **Events**, each containing multiple **Races**, which in turn have multiple **Classes**.
- Enter and display **race results** with raw finish times and handicap-corrected scores.
- Role-based authentication with four user types:
  - **Sudo**: Full access.
  - **Event Organiser**: Can manage events, races, classes, and results.
  - **Race Official**: Can upload and query results.
  - **User**: View results without login.
- File-based JSON data storage to avoid dependencies on traditional databases.
- Results export/import possible via JSON files (to be implemented).
- Server-rendered pages for broad compatibility and performance.
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling using CDN (no Node.js build required).

## Setup

1. Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 7 or later recommended).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the project with:
`dotnet run`
4. Open a browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001` (or the URL shown in the console).

5. Login as `admin` with password `P@ssword1` for full access.

## Usage

- Create events and add races and classes using the web interface (for authorised users).
- Enter race results with finish times; handicap scoring calculations will be applied.
- View results and navigate through events, races, and classes as non-authenticated users.

## TODO

- Implement proper user management and registration.
- Add scoring algorithms for Portsmouth, IRC, and YTC.
- Export/import results in JSON and human-readable formats.
- Add editing and deleting of races, classes, and results.
